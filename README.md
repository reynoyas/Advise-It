## Description
This project aims to provide a convenient platform for students and advisors 
to make plans and schedules for future classes. Using a token-based system, 
students and advisors will be able to create and save their plans, and easily 
access and update them in the future. The project utilizes an older framework, 
specifically Fat-Free, to develop the application. Despite the use of an older
framework, the application will be designed to be user-friendly and efficient, 
allowing students and advisors to easily create, manage, and update their plans
for future classes.

powerful tool to effectively oversee and manage the plans created by students.
